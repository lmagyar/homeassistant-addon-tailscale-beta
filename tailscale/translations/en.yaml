configuration:
  accept_dns:
    name: Accept DNS
    description: >-
      This option allows you to accept DNS settings of your tailnet that are
      configured on the DNS page of the admin console.
      This option is enabled by default.
  accept_routes:
    name: Accept routes
    description: >-
      This option allows you to accept subnet routes advertised by other nodes
      in your tailnet.
      This option is enabled by default.
  advertise_exit_node:
    name: Advertise as an exit node
    description: >-
      This option allows you to advertise this Tailscale instance as an exit node.
      By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to
      route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN.
      This option is enabled by default.
  advertise_connector:
    name: Advertise as an app connector
    description: >-
      When you use an app connector, you specify which applications you wish to make
      accessible over your tailnet, and the domains for those applications. Any traffic
      for that application is then forced over the tailnet to a node running an app
      connector before egressing to the target domains.
      This option is enabled by default.
  advertise_routes:
    name: Advertise subnet routes
    description: >-
      This option allows you to advertise routes to subnets (accessible on the network
      your device is connected to) to other clients on your tailnet.
      The add-on by default will advertise routes to your subnets on all supported
      interfaces by adding `local_subnets` to the list.
  dscp:
    name: DSCP
    description: >-
      This option allows you to set DSCP value on all tailscaled originated network
      traffic. This allows you to handle Tailscale's network traffic on your router
      separately from other network traffic.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default, ie. DSCP will be set to the
      default 0.
  exit_node:
    name: Use exit node
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify another Tailscale instance as an exit node for
      this device.
      By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to
      route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN.
      This option is unused by default.
  lets_encrypt_certfile:
    name: Let's Encrypt certificate chain file storage location
    description: >-
      The name of the certificate file generated by Tailscale Serve using Let's Encrypt.
      The file is stored in the /ssl/ folder.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default.
  lets_encrypt_keyfile:
    name: Let's Encrypt certificate key file storage location
    description: >-
      The name of the private key file generated by Tailscale Serve using Let's Encrypt.
      The file is stored in the /ssl/ folder.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default.
  log_level:
    name: Log level
    description: >-
      Controls the level of log details the add-on provides.
      This only applies to the add-on itself, not Tailscale.
  login_server:
    name: Login server
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify a custom control server for this
      Tailscale instance, for example, a self-host Headscale instance.
      By default, it uses the control server provided by Tailscale.
  share_homeassistant:
    name: Share Home Assistant with Serve or Funnel
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable Tailscale Serve or Funnel features to present
      your Home Assistant instance with a valid certificate on your tailnet or
      internet.
      This option is disabled by default.
  share_on_port:
    name: Share on port
    description: >-
      This option allows you to configure the port the Tailscale Serve and Funnel
      features are accessible on the tailnet and internet.
      Only port number 443, 8443 and 10000 is allowed by Tailscale.
      Port number 443 is used by default.
  snat_subnet_routes:
    name: Source NAT subnet routes
    description: >-
      This option allows subnet devices to see the traffic originating from the
      subnet router, and this simplifies routing configuration.
      To support advanced Site-to-site networking (eg. to traverse multiple
      networks), you can disable this functionality.
      This option is enabled by default.
  stateful_filtering:
    name: Stateful packet filtering
    description: >-
      This option enables stateful packet filtering on packet-forwarding nodes (exit
      nodes, subnet routers, and app connectors), to only allow return packets for
      existing outbound connections.
      This option is disabled by default.
  tags:
    name: Tags
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this
      Tailscale instance. They need to start with `tag:`.
  taildrive:
    name: Taildrive shares
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify which Home Assistant directories you want to
      share with other Tailscale nodes using Taildrive.
      Only the listed directories are available.
  taildrop:
    name: Taildrop
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable Taildrop, a file sharing service
      that allows you to share files with other Tailscale nodes.
      This option is enabled by default.
  userspace_networking:
    name: Userspace networking mode
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable userspace networking mode.
      If you need to access other clients on your tailnet from your Home
      Assistant instance, disable userspace networking mode, which will create a
      `tailscale0` network interface on your host.
      This option is enabled by default.
network:
  41641/udp: >-
    UDP port to listen on for WireGuard and peer-to-peer traffic.
    When not set, an automatically selected port is used by default.
