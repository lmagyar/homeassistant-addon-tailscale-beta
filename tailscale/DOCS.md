# Home Assistant Custom Add-on: Tailscale

![Warning][warning_stripe]

> This is a **fork** of the [community add-on][community_addon]!
>
> This fork:
>   - Enables Tailscale's Funnel feature
>   - Enables Tailscale's Proxy feature
>   - Enables Tailscale's SOCKS5 and HTTP outbound proxy
>   - Allows customizing the login server

![Warning][warning_stripe]

## Prerequisites

In order to use this add-on, you'll need a Tailscale account.

It is free to use for personal & hobby projects, up to 20 clients/devices on a
single user account. Sign up using your Google, Microsoft or GitHub account at
the following URL:

<https://login.tailscale.com/start>

You can also create an account during the add-on installation processes,
however, it is nice to know where you need to go later on.

## Installation

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** ->
   **Add-on Store**.
1. In the **...** menu at the top right corner click **Repositories**, add
   `https://github.com/lmagyar/homeassistant-addon-tailscale` as repository.
1. Find the "Tailscale" add-on and click it. If it doesn't show up, wait until
   HA refreshes the information about the add-on, or click **Reload** in the
   **...** menu at the top right corner.
1. Click the "INSTALL" button to install the add-on.

## How to use

1. Start the "Tailscale" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Tailscale" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Open the **Web UI** of the "Tailscale" add-on to complete authentication and
   couple your Home Assistant instance with your Tailscale account.

   **Note:** _Some browsers don't work with this step. It is recommended to
   complete this step on a desktop or laptop computer using the Chrome browser._

1. Check the logs of the "Tailscale" add-on again to see if everything went
   well.

## Configuration

This add-on has almost no additional configuration options for the
add-on itself.

However, when logging in to Tailscale, you can configure your Tailscale
network right from their interface.

<https://login.tailscale.com/>

The add-on exposes "Exit Node" capabilities that you can enable from your
Tailscale account. Additionally, if the Supervisor managed your network (which
is the default), the add-on will also advertise routes to your subnets on all
supported interfaces to Tailscale.

Consider disabling key expiry to avoid losing connection to your Home Assistant
device. See [Key expiry][tailscale_info_key_expiry] for more information.

To allow Home Assistant and other add-ons to access your Tailscale network the
add-on also provides a SOCKS5/HTTP proxy. The proxy protocol is unauthenticated.
See [Userspace networking][tailscale_info_userspace_networking] for more
information.

1. Navigate to the [Machines page][tailscale_machines] of the admin console, and
   find your Home Assistant instance.

1. Click on the **&hellip;** icon at the right side and select the "Edit route
   settings..." option. The "Exit node" and "Subnet routes" functions can be
   enabled here.

1. Click on the **&hellip;** icon at the right side and select the "Disable key
   expiry" option.

## Add-on configuration

```yaml
tags:
  - tag:example
  - tag:homeassistant
log_level: info
```

### Option: `tags`

This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this Tailscale
instance. They need to start with `tag:`.

More information: [ACL tags][tailscale_info_acls]

### Option: `log_level`

Optionally enable tailscaled debug messages in the add-on's log. Turn it on only
in case you are troubleshooting, because Tailscale's daemon is quite chatty.

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `notice`: Normal but significant events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `login_server`

This option allows you to specify an alternative login server instead of the
default `https://controlplane.tailscale.com`. You can for example specify a
selfhosted [headscale][headscale] instance.

## Taildrop

This add-on support [Tailscale's Taildrop][taildrop] feature, which allows
you to send files to your Home Assistant instance from other Tailscale
devices.

Received files are stored in the `/share/taildrop` directory.

## Tailscale Proxy

Tailscale can provide a TLS certificate for your Home Assistant device within
your tailnet domain.

This can prevent browsers to warn that HTTP URLs to your Home Assistant device
look unencrypted (browsers are not aware of that connections between Tailscale
nodes are secured with end-to-end encryption).

More information: [Enabling HTTPS][tailscale_info_https]

1. Configure Home Assistant to be accessible through HTTP connection (this is
   the default). See [HTTP integration documentation][http_integration] for more
   information. If you still want to use another HTTPS connection to access Home
   Assistant, please use a reverse proxy add-on.

1. Home Assistant, by default, blocks requests from reverse proxies, like the
   Tailscale Proxy. In order to enable it, add the following lines to your
   `configuration.yaml`, without changing anything:

   ```yaml
   http:
     use_x_forwarded_for: true
     trusted_proxies:
       - 127.0.0.1
   ```

1. Navigate to the [DNS page][tailscale_dns] of the admin console:

   - Choose a Tailnet name.

   - Enable MagicDNS if not already enabled.

   - Under HTTPS Certificates section, click Enable HTTPS.

1. Restart the add-on.

**Note:** _You should not use any port number in the url that you used
previously to access Home Assistant. Tailscale Proxy works on the default HTTPS
port 443._

## Tailscale Funnel

With the Tailscale Funnel feature you can access your Home Assistant instance
from the wider internet using your Tailscale domain (like
`https://homeassistant.tail1234.ts.net`) even from devices **without installed
Tailscale VPN client** (eg. general phones, tablets, laptops).

> **Client** &#8658; _Internet_ &#8658; **Tailscale Funnel** (TCP proxy) &#8658;
  _VPN_ &#8658; **Tailscale Proxy** (HTTPS proxy) &#8594; **HA** (HTTP
  web-server)

Without the Tailscale Funnel feature, you will be able to access your Home
Assistant instance only when your devices (eg. phones, tablets, laptops) are
connected to your Tailscale VPN, there will be no Internet &#8658; VPN TCP
proxying for HTTPS communication.

More information: [Tailscale Funnel][tailscale_info_funnel]

1. Navigate to the [Access controls page][tailscale_acls] of the admin console,
   and add the below policy entries to the policy file. See [Server role
   accounts using ACL tags][tailscale_info_acls] for more information.

   ```json
   {
     "nodeAttrs": [
       {
         "target": ["autogroup:members"],
         "attr":   ["funnel"],
       },
     ],
   }
   ```

1. Restart the add-on.

**Note**: _After initial set up it can take up to 10 minutes for the domain to
be publicly available. You can use the `dig` command (Linux/MacOS) to regularly
check if an A-record is already present for your domain (`dig
<machine-name>.<tailnet-name>.ts.net +short` should return an IP address once
the record is published)._

**Note:** _You should not use any port number in the url that you used
previously to access Home Assistant. Tailscale Funnel works on the default HTTPS
port 443._

**Note:** _If you encounter strange browser behaviour or strange error messages,
try to clear all site related cookies, clear all browser cache, restart browser._
