# Home Assistant Custom App: Tailscale with features

Zero config VPN for building secure networks.

![Warning][warning_stripe]

> This is a **fork** of the [community app][community_app]!
>
> Changes:
> - Release pending changes from community app
>   - Make all config options mandatory, fill in the default values for previously optional config options
>   - Make accept_routes, advertise_connector, advertise_exit_node, advertise_routes, taildrop and userspace_networking options default disabled to align with stock Tailscale's platform-specific behavior
>   - Rename tags option to advertise_tags to align with stock Tailscale's naming convention - ***config is automatically updated***
>   - Add support for Taildrive
>   - Fix MagicDNS incompatibility with Home Assistant
>   - Make always use derp option configurable
>   - Create persistent notification also (not just log warning) when key expiration is detected
> - Withhold changes from community app (will be released here later)
>   - Drop support for armv7 architecture
>   - Update App base image to v19 (drop armv7 support)
> - Release unmerged changes from community app
>   - Make Tailscale SSH configurable
>   - Optionally copy Tailscale Serve's certificate files to /ssl folder
>   - Make DSCP configurable on tailscaled's network traffic
>   - Configure log format for the app to be compatible with Tailscale's format

> One-click migration from the community app to this fork:
> - Install the **Advanced SSH & Web Terminal** app and disable it's protection mode
> - From the cli execute: `curl -s -o /tmp/migrate_from_community_add_on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmagyar/homeassistant-addon-tailscale/refs/heads/main/scripts/migrate_from_community_add_on && bashio /tmp/migrate_from_community_add_on`
>
> **Note:**
> - This will install the forked version (if not alredy installed), backup and
>   stop the community version, copy and update the configuration, and (this is
>   the big thing) will also copy the internal state of the app, then start
>   the forked version.
> - With copying the app internal state, the new forked app will start up
>   with the exact same state, ie. with the same tailnet authentication also. So
>   **do not** remove the current device from Tailscale's admin page, the forked
>   app will jump into it's place.
> - And even if you executed previously some tailscale configuration inside the
>   apps container, those settings will be also migrated with the internal
>   state.
> - **But copying the app's internal state requires executing bash and python
>   scripts inside the Supervisors container! Executng python scripts requires
>   installing gdb and pyrasite inside the Supervisor's container (they will be
>   uninstalled by the script also). So please create a complete system backup
>   before executing this script!**
